Customer agrees to pay all sales, use, value-added, goods and services, consumption, withholding, excise and any other similar taxes or government charges, exclusive of Licensor's income taxes. Except as expressly set forth in the "Termination" or "Remedies" section,
all fees and charges paid under or in connection with the Agreement are non-refundable and no right of set off exists. Licensor does not permit aggregation of products, services, purchase or license models or cumulative fees paid across separate Product Lines to trigger preferred pricing or discounts. Customer agrees that Licensor's license to Customer of any rights hereunder to the Software, the Consulting Services and/or the Maintenance is expressly conditioned on Customer's strict adherence and compliance with Customer's payment obligations to Licensor hereunder, and Customer's obligation not to make any unauthorized copies, derivative works, distribution, display or performance of the Software, or to violate any restriction or use limitation of the Software.

All proprietary notices incorporated in or affixed to any Protected Materials must be duplicated by Customer on all copies of the Protected Materials, as applicable, and must not be altered, removed or obliterated. Except as stated herein, Customer receives no other rights to use any of Licensor's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.
6. Confidentiality. Each party agrees to protect Confidential Information in the same manner as it protects its own (but using no less than a reasonable degree of protection) and may only disclose Confidential Information to those with a need to know that information and who have agreed in writing to be bound by terms at least as protective as those contained in the Agreement. It is understood that the confidentiality provisions contained herein do not apply to any information that can be demonstrated by written evidence is: (a) available to the public other than by a breach of a confidentiality obligation, (b) rightfully received from a third party not in breach of a confidentiality obligation, (c) independently developed by one party without use of the Confidential Information of the other; or (d) known to the recipient at the time of disclosure (other than under a separate confidentiality obligation).; or (e) produced in compliance with applicable law or court order, provided the other party is given
reasonable advance notice of the obligation to produce Confidential Information (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the disclosing party's cost, if the disclosing party wishes to contest the disclosure.

Each party agrees to indemnify the other for any damages (including reasonable expenses) the other may sustain resulting from a breach of this Section and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for a breach of confidentiality. The parties are entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief under this clause without the necessity of posting a bond even if otherwise normally required. Such injunctive or equitable relief shall not be the exclusive remedy for any breach of confidentiality, but is in addition to all other rights and remedies
available at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Licensor's source code shall be kept confidential in perpetuity. Affiliates of either party are included in the definition of "Licensor" and "Customer", respectively, for purposes of this Section entitled "Confidentiality". Confidential Information remains the sole property of the disclosing party, and each party acknowledges and agrees that it does not acquire any rights therein. Use by a recipient of Confidential Information for the purposes contemplated under the Agreement, including, but not limited to, any configuration or use by Customer of the Software or Materials, does not affect or diminish the disclosing party's rights, title and interest in and to Confidential Information.

8. Additional Customer Obligations.

(b) Customer shall provide Licensor with good faith cooperation and access to such information, facilities, personnel and equipment as may be reasonably required by Licensor in order to perform its obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to, providing security access, information, and software interfaces to
Customer's applications.

Licensor shall be entitled to rely on all decisions and approvals of Customer.

Furthermore, Licensor will indemnify and hold Customer harmless from and against damages, costs and fees reasonably incurred (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that are attributable exclusively to such claim or action and which are assessed against Customer in a final judgment ("Indemnity"). Licensor's obligations to defend, settle or indemnify Customer are subject to Customer promptly notifying Licensor in writing of such claim; Licensor having the exclusive right to control such defense and/or settlement; and Customer providing reasonable assistance (at Licensor's expense) in the defense thereof.

Either party may terminate: (a) this Agreement and/or any or all applicable Order Forms upon thirty (30) days prior written notice if the other party breaches a material provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within the thirty (30) day notice period; (b) Maintenance, Term License or Subscription, upon prior written notice at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of any applicable annual Maintenance period or Term; or (c) an Order Form for Consulting Services, upon fifteen (15) days prior written notice by Customer or thirty (30) days prior written notice by Licensor. Order Forms that are not terminated or have not expired shall remain in full force and effect under this Agreement. The Agreement shall automatically terminate if either party files for bankruptcy, goes into receivership, becomes insolvent or makes an
assignment for the benefit of creditors. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement or an Order Form, Customer must cease using, de-install and permanently delete all of the applicable Software; whether or not modified or merged into other materials. Termination of this Agreement or any Order Form shall not limit either party from pursuing other remedies available to it, including injunctive relief, nor shall such termination relieve Customer of its obligation to pay all fees that have accrued or are otherwise owed by Customer under this Agreement. 
17. Suspension. Licensor will be entitled to suspend any or all Software Services, Maintenance and/or Consulting Services upon 10 days written notice to Customer in the event Customer is in breach of this Agreement. Further, Licensor may suspend Customer's access and use of the Software Services if, and so long as, in Licensor's sole judgment, there is a security risk created by Customer that may interfere with the proper continued provision of the Software Services or the operation of Licensor's network or systems. Licensor will provide Customer advance notice of any such suspension at Licensor's reasonable discretion based on the nature of the circumstances giving rise to the suspension. Licensor will use reasonable efforts to re-establish the affected Software Services promptly after Licensor determines, in its reasonable discretion, that the situation giving rise the suspension has been cured by Customer. Licensor may terminate the Software Services if any of the foregoing causes of suspension remain
uncured by Customer. If Software Services are terminated by Licensor due to the foregoing, Licensor shall either provide Customer with or allow Customer access sufficient to retrieve all Customer's Output in comma separated value (CSV) format. Customer shall pay Licensor for its work resolving the situation giving rise to the suspension on a T&M basis, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
18. General Provisions
(a) All notices required under this Agreement shall be in writing. Notices will be effective if dispatched by facsimile; or electronic mail; by hand; reliable overnight delivery service or first-class, pre-paid mail if sent to the contract address for the intended recipient set forth in an Order Form. A copy of any notice of default, breach or termination shall also being sent to that party's General Counsel. 
(b) The losing party shall pay all reasonable costs, including, without limitation attorney's fees, incurred by the prevailing party in any action brought to enforce the prevailing party's rights under this Agreement. 
(c) This Agreement shall not be interpreted to create an agency or consignment relationship, and neither party is a partner, employee, agent or joint venture partner of, or with, the other. 
(d) During the term of any Order Form and for a period of one (1) year following expiration or termination of an Order Form, neither party shall actively solicit for employment any employee, contractor, or consultant, or other representative of the other party who performed services in connection with the applicable Order Form, without the prior written consent of the other party. 
(e) Licensor may designate any agent or subcontractor to perform such tasks and functions to complete any services covered under this Agreement. However, nothing in the preceding sentence shall relieve Licensor from responsibility for performance of its duties under the terms of this Agreement. 
(f) During the term of any Order Form and for a period of one (1) year following expiration or termination of an Order Form, Customer hereby grants Licensor and its independent auditors, at Licensor's expense, the right to audit Customer's compliance with this Agreement upon ten (10) days' notice and at reasonable times and to report any results to Licensor's licensors. Customer shall at no cost to Licensor (i) provide any assistance reasonably requested by Licensor or its designee in conducting any such audit, including installing and operating audit software, (ii) make requested personnel, records, and information available to Licensor or its designee, and (iii) in all cases, provide such assistance, personnel, records, systems access and information in an expeditious manner to facilitate the timely completion of such compliance verification. Customer's failure to comply with the provisions of this section will constitute a material breach of this Agreement. If the audit reveals any noncompliance, Customer
shall reimburse Licensor for the reasonable costs and expenses of the audit (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees), and Customer shall promptly cure any such noncompliance; provided, however, that the obligations under this section do not constitute a waiver of Licensor's termination rights and do not affect Licensor's right to payment for Software, Software Services or Materials related to usage in excess of the Number of Units. 
(g) No waiver by either party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of that or any other provision on any other occasion. 
(h) Dates or times by which one party is required to perform under the Agreement shall be postponed automatically for so long as that party is prevented from performing by any act of or failure to act by, the other party. No delay or default in performance of any obligation by either party (except payment obligations), shall constitute a breach of the Agreement to the extent caused by force majeure or any other cause which is beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, fires, strikes, accidents, or acts of God. 
(i) Except for an assignment, in whole or part, by Licensor to an Affiliate, neither party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, and/or any of its rights and/or obligations without the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). Any such attempted assignment shall be void. For the purposes of the foregoing, a change in control of Customer is deemed to cause or attempt to cause an assignment of the Agreement, in whole or part, and shall require Licensor's prior written consent. 
(j) To the extent Customer or its successors or assigns enters into an Extraordinary Corporate Event after an Order Form Effective Date, those users, divisions or entities, which were added to or divested from Customer's organization as a result of the Extraordinary Corporate Event are not authorized to use the Software or Materials until those users, divisions or entities are added to this Agreement by way of a written amendment signed by duly authorized officers of the Licensor and Customer, or in the case of a divesture, the divested entity. 
(k) This Agreement is for the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns, and does not confer any rights or benefits on any third party, including any employee of a party, any client of a party, or any employee of a client of a party. Notwithstanding the above, the parties acknowledge that all rights and benefits afforded to Licensor under this Agreement shall apply equally to the owner of any Third Party Software, and such third party is an intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement. 
(l) The parties' rights and obligations under this section and sections entitled "Financial Terms", "Proprietary Notices", "Confidentiality", "Warranties and Disclaimers", "Indemnity", "Indemnity and Warranty Exclusions", "Remedies", "Disclaimers", "Limitation of Liability", "General Provisions" and those surviving provisions of the Supplemental Terms shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement and/or an Order Form. 
(m) If Customer is entering into the Agreement from a European Union member country, Norway, Switzerland, Japan, India or Australia, then the Agreement is governed by the laws of England and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales. Otherwise, the Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Federal Court for the Northern District Court of California, without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to this Agreement. 
(n) If any sentence, clause or other provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, including, but not limited to, any limitation of liability, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining clauses and provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby. The affected provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to render it enforceable while attempting to closely approximate the intent and the economic effect of the affected provision.
19. Agreement Structure and Scope.
(a) Order of precedence. To the extent any terms and conditions of the Master Terms or Supplemental Terms conflict with the terms and conditions of additional license requirements or notices contained in the Documentation, then such license requirements or notices pertaining to Third Party Software included with the Software, shall control. To the extent any terms and conditions of these Master Terms conflict with the Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms shall control. To the extent the Order Form conflicts with the Master Terms or Supplemental Terms, the Order Form shall control. 
(b) Entire Agreement. The Agreement constitutes the parties' entire agreement relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, agreements, requests for proposals, proposals, conditions, representations, and warranties, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter. No modification to the Agreement will be binding unless in writing and includes a signature by an authorized representative of each party, except in the case of an Order Form where Licensor's acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on Licensor's initial delivery of products or services under the Order Form. All pre-printed or standard terms of any Customer purchase order or other business processing document shall have no effect.

You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.

You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.

When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
